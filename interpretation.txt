One of our API methods allows users to generate a Folium heatmap of places
of worship based on religion, and for the visual included we filtered based
on Buddhist institutions. While every other religion included in this dataset
had the largest hub of institutions in New York City, we noticed that this
pattern did not follow for those under the Buddhist category. Buddhism seems
to have the most concentrated hub in Southern California, specifically the
Los Angeles metropolitan area. After further research, we learned that
historical immigration from East and Southeast Asian countries has influenced
the spread of Buddhism in this region, which now holds the largest Buddhist
temple outside Asia with over 75% of members being non-Asian.
